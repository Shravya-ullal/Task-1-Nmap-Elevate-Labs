# 🔍 Task 1: Port Scanning Your Local Network with Nmap

## 🚀 Objective

The goal of this task is to understand **network reconnaissance** by scanning the local network for **open ports** using **Nmap**. This helps identify potential vulnerabilities and understand how exposed a network is.

---

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **Nmap** - A free and open-source network scanner.
- *(Optional)* **Wireshark** - A network protocol analyzer to visualize network traffic during the scan.
- **GitHub** - To submit the task and maintain code/screenshot documentation.

---

## 🌐 Steps Performed

1. **Installed Nmap** from the official site: [https://nmap.org](https://nmap.org)
2. **Found my local IP range** using:
   - `ipconfig` (Windows)

3. **Performed a TCP SYN scan**:

## 🌐 Steps Performed

1. **Installed Nmap** from the official site: [https://nmap.org](https://nmap.org)
2. **Found my local IP range** using:
   - `ipconfig` (Windows) / `ip a` (Linux)
   
3. **Performed a TCP SYN scan**:
Saved the results to a file:

(Optional) Captured traffic using Wireshark to visualize how Nmap sends SYN packets and receives SYN-ACK replies.
